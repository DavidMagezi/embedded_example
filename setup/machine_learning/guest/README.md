# Set up machine learning on guest
Copy the library (dlib),the dataset (MNIST), and the trained model parameters (mnist\_networt.dat) over to the guest. For example using [transfer\_to\_guest.sh](transfer_to_guest), or your favourite file manager application.

Take care to transfer to the root partion of the guest (virtual machine).
